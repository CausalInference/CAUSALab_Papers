There are two folders within this folder. One with analytic code for the applied example and one with analytic code for simulations.

For the simulations, multiples_simulation.R runs the simulations and simulation_plots.R creates the plot (Figure 2).

For the applied example, multiples_descriptive.R creates descriptive tables (Tables 2 and 3), model_fitting.R fits regression models, and combined_forest.R plots the results of the fitted models (Figure 3 and Appendix Figure 2). sensitivity_analysis.R outputs the table of results for the sensitivity analysis restricting to single gestation (Appendix Table 1).
